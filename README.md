# Axie's Challenge
## Thiên Lê

The simulation battle between attackers and defenders Axies that I've created follow up the challenge rule. But it looks like the attackers win all the time. So I decided to give the defenders some new abilities to help them :)) and make the game look more balanced, challenging and more fun ✨Magic ✨

## Features

- The largest map that I can generate which more than 8k Axies (with some conditions :D )
- A simple mini map
- Zoom & drag battlefield
- Smoothly HP Bar
- Pause & Change Speed Simulate
- A Power Bar to show the real-time relative power (total HP) between 2 teams
- Click on any Axie to show its properties and use skills
- A short and fun story (every game must have a story to be called a game)

## Tech

- [DOTween] - A Unity Tween Engine
